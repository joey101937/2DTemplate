GameDemo package is a collection of simple examples designed to show how different aspects of JEngine can be used. Generally these examples will be very simle. Less a 'Game'and more of a technical demo. Keeping things simple is done so that people can follow the project's logic easily and understant how to implement JEngine features into their own project.
